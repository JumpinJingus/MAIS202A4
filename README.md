# MAIS202A4 - Andy Lee & Monami Waki

A Kaggle Machine Learning Competition hosted by MAIS 202.

The objective is to utilize a Convolutional Neural Network Architecture to identify the highest valued MNIST digit in a greyscale image containing multiple digits. 

## How to Reproduce Results

The project was written using Google Colaboratory. 
The best score from the model was around 0.86.
The model should perform better when the number of epochs is increased beyond 10, as it was not overfitting with 10 epochs.

To replicate the results simply do the following:

1. Download the .py file.
2. Load into Google Colab.
3. Run from beginning to end.
